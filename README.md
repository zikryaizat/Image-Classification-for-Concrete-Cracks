# Image-Classification-for-Concrete-Cracks

**Concrete Cracks**
Concrete cracks refer to fissures or fractures that develop in concrete structures over time due to various factors such as shrinkage, settlement, excessive loading, or environmental conditions. These cracks can compromise the integrity and stability of the structure if left unaddressed. Regular inspection and maintenance are crucial to identify and repair cracks promptly, preventing further deterioration and ensuring the longevity of concrete elements.

**About Project**
This code project focuses on image classification to distinguish between concrete samples with and without cracks. Leveraging TensorFlow and Keras, it employs machine learning techniques to train a model capable of accurately categorizing concrete images based on the presence or absence of cracks. The model's performance is validated using two test images—one depicting cracked concrete and the other representing intact concrete—ensuring the reliability and effectiveness of the classification. Through this project, the goal is to develop a robust and efficient system for automated detection of concrete cracks, which could have significant implications for infrastructure maintenance and safety.

**Result**
For the result, the model achieve more than 90% accuracy. The result was showned in the form of graphs.
